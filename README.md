# Find user's intention based on given Question
  This is a demo application created in Python on Natural Laguage Processing using nltk. The application asks user to enter his/her question, then process the question and give back the user's intention as a result. Currently below intentions were trained.
  
  *Name<br />*Howd'y<br />*Experience<br />*Location<br />
  <p>Here in this simple demo programme, I am trying  to identify the user intention based on the paraphrasing concept. Paraphrasing means, you can construct different words to form a sentence whose meaning is same.
# Setup
  Install Python 3.6 <br/>
  pip install nltk

# Demo
  Run the demo.py file from your cmd prompt<br />
     nltkDemo>python demo.py<br />

      <br/>
  The application waits for user question, once a question is given, it will process it and give its response.<br />

# Further Development
  You can clone this repository and train/enhance further to identify more intentions.
